# ASCII SNAKE
Snake is a classic arcade game that has been enjoyed by players for decades. This is a project that I worked on during my first year of college. It is a simple ASCII-based implementation of the game that is displayed using ANSI escape codes on a terminal. It also has an AI feature.

## Features

- ASCII-based snake game
- Displayed using ANSI escape codes on a terminal
- Implements rudimentary Q-learning algorithm
## Usage

To run the game, run **make** on a terminal or compile *lib/* and *src/* and link them, then you can run it as you would any compiled program.
Once the game is running, use the w a s d keys to move the snake around the screen.
The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without the snake's own tail.
## Notes

This implementation of Snake is not intended to be a fully polished and optimized game. It was a learning exercise for me. As such, the code quality may not be the best and the AI implementation may be incomplete or suboptimal.
Please note that this implementation has only been tested on Debian-based systems such as Mint and Ubuntu.
